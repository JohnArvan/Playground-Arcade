#Playground-Arcade

An arcade Windows Forms application for desktop use, including 4 iconic games, Solitaire, Wordle, Checkers and Othello. This arcade is meant to provide entertainment to those who are bored of reading books and tired of wasting money on TV/Streaming services, aimed more at less tech-savvy people, namely the older generation. 

How to Deploy:
	Main Menu containing: Solitaire, Wordle, and Checkers:
Open Visual Studio and select “Clone a repository”
For the repository location, enter: https://github.com/JohnArvan/Playground-Arcade
For the path, choose an empty folder on your computer, then click “Clone”
Run the program, and the user interface for the main menu of the application will open. From there you can select a game to play by clicking the corresponding button.
	Othello (separate instructions due to git merge issues)
On the GitHub, go to the branch named “othello-v2”
Open that folder as a Windows Forms Application (.NET Framework) project on Visual Studio
Run the program, and the user interface for the game will load in a form, displaying the board, disks and all other needed UI
